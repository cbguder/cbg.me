## About

I'm a software engineer, originally from Turkey, living in San Francisco. I work at [Pivotal Labs][pivotal-labs]. [This][photo] is what I look like.

## Projects

[BestPractices][] is a collection of things I consider to be best practices in test-driven iOS development.

[elrio][] is a cap inset detector & optimizer for resizable UIKit assets. [Gem][elrio-gem].

[FLAC2iTunes][] is a [FLAC][] importer for iTunes.

I also contribute to [Cedar][], [sprout][] and [thrust][].
